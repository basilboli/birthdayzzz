DESCRIPTION:
This is a simple script that automatically posts "HAPPY BIRTHDAY" like phrase on your friends wall on his birthday.

WHO CAN BE INTERESTED:
people having a lot of facebook friends and annoyed of writing simple "happy birthday" phases on the friends wall.

WHAT IT DOES:
- on every launch it requests you friends list using your access_token
- builds today birthday candidates 
- post contgrat phrase to the wall (there are more that 30 messages in different languages)

WHAT IT DOESN'T:
- it doesn't persist ANY data to ANY database

DEPLOY:
0. before using you should get you access_token 
(see https://developers.facebook.com/docs/authentication/)
1. run main.py once or use cron for automatic daily launch

OPEN ISSUES:
token should be updated every x days as fb got rid of offline_access
